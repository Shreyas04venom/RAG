# Edith — Grounded Voice Evidence RAG Assistant

Edith is a high-performance, voice-enabled Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) assistant with grounded evidence verification, real-time audio visualization, dynamic citations, and low-latency streaming.

## 🚀 Features

- **Voice & Multimodal RAG**: Real-time microphone listening, speech transcription, neural intent classification, and low-latency audio response playback.
- **Hybrid Retrieval**: Dense vector embeddings paired with sparse BM25 keyword matching and Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF).
- **Grounded Verification**: Hallucination detection and claim grounding score against MS MARCO evidence passages.
- **Session History Drawer**: Full query/response history persisted across tab interactions via sessionStorage with instant restore capabilities.
- **Telemetry & Pipeline Inspector**: Complete latency breakdown and architecture inspection across all RAG pipeline stages.
